Short Answer
1. Why does a programmer use pseudocode?

Answer: to help them formulate algorithms. This is an essential step to creating algorithms because they tend to be so complex it's hard to write the core of the algorithm in a programming language from scratch. Many parts of the algorithm will need research and time to figure out after the pseudo code has been created as a template to direct them to the desired result.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Answer: Nothing, pseudo code is not meant for computers to read, it is created for human's to read only.

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number 
INPUT second number 
COMPARE first number to second number and store the result in greaterNumber
RETURN greaterNumber 

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET sum to 0
WHILE sum is less than 101 
	ADD one number to sum 
PRINT sum 

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT a name 
IF the name is found 
	PRINT number connected with name searched
ELSE 
	PRINT contact cannot be found 

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function returnNumber(inputName){
    for (i=0; i<phonebook.length; i++){
        if (inputName == phonebook[i].name){
            return phonebook[i].phone;
        }  
    }
    alert ("contact cannot be found");
  }
var phonebook = [
	{name: 'Justin', phone: "(555)368-3604"}, 
	{name: 'Max', phone: "(555)368-3654"}, 
	{name: 'David', phone: "(555)368-6604"}, 
	{name: 'Paul', phone: "(555)368-2604"}
	]; 
var inputName = 'Justin';
